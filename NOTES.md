# Notes
Let me know if you ever want my help with back end cause i need stuff to do Winston
Possibly remove retraction as a setting
Potentially create an FAQ
Clean up instructions: Potentially also add to FAQ
Add a way for user input: later on, after base design decided upon
Narrator still acts a little strange
